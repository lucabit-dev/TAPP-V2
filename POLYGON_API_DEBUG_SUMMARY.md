# Polygon API Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Timezone Issue - FIXED
**Problem:** The trading session detection was using local server time instead of Eastern Time (NYSE timezone).

**Impact:** This could cause incorrect session detection if the server was running in a different timezone, leading to:
- Wrong data ranges being fetched
- Incorrect extended hours detection
- Mismatched trading session information

**Fix:** Added `getEasternTime()` method that properly converts UTC to Eastern Time using the `America/New_York` timezone.

**Files Changed:**
- `polygonService.js` - Updated `getCurrentTradingSession()` and `getExtendedTradingHoursRange()` methods

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Error Handling - ADDED
**Improvement:** Added better error logging and debugging information to help identify issues faster.

**Changes:**
- Added API key status logging on initialization
- Enhanced error messages with more context
- Added success logging for successful API calls
- Better error handling for HTTP errors

### 3. ✅ API Connection Status - VERIFIED
**Result:** Polygon API connection is working correctly.

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Current price endpoint: Working
- ✅ OHLCV endpoint: Working
- ✅ 1-minute candles: Working
- ✅ 5-minute candles: Working
- ✅ Company info endpoint: Working

## Current Configuration

### API Key
- **Status:** Using fallback API key
- **Key:** `oLNQ0GD8RpIcP8X2iApVnlzg28P6Ttcc` (hardcoded fallback)
- **Recommendation:** Set `POLYGON_API_KEY` environment variable for production use

### Environment Variables
To properly configure the Polygon API, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Polygon.io API Configuration
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_polygon_api_key_here

# Other configuration...
```

## Testing

The API was tested with the following:
- Symbol: AAPL
- Date Range: 7 days
- Endpoints: All major endpoints tested successfully
- Results: All endpoints returned data correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Set Environment Variable:** Create a `.env` file with your Polygon API key
2. **Monitor Logs:** Check console logs for `[Polygon]` prefixed messages
3. **Check API Limits:** Ensure you're within Polygon.io API rate limits
4. **Verify Timezone:** The system now correctly uses Eastern Time for trading hours

## Next Steps

1. If you're still experiencing issues, check:
   - Network connectivity
   - API key validity
   - Rate limiting
   - Check server logs for specific error messages

2. For production deployment:
   - Set up proper environment variables
   - Monitor API usage
   - Implement rate limiting if needed
   - Set up alerts for API failures

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the console logs for `[Polygon]` messages
2. Verify your API key is valid
3. Check Polygon.io API status page
4. Review the error messages for specific issues
